vhost_net: passing raw xdp buff to tun

This patches implement a TUN specific msg_control:

#define TUN_MSG_UBUF 1
#define TUN_MSG_PTR  2
struct tun_msg_ctl {
       int type;
       void *ptr;
};

The first supported type is ubuf which is already used by vhost_net
zerocopy code. The second is XDP buff, which allows vhost_net to pass
XDP buff to TUN. This could be used to implement accepting an array of
XDP buffs from vhost_net in the following patches.
