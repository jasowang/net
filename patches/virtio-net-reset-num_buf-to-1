virtio-net: reset num_buf to 1 after linearizing packet

If we successfully linearize the packets, num_buf were set to zero,
but this won't work for the error path which assumes at least one. It
will lead the code try to pop the buffers of next packet and drop
it. Fixing this by set num_buf to 1 if we successfully linearize the
packet.
