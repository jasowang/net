tuntap: XDP_TX can use native XDP transmission routine

We used to build skb and call generic XDP helpers to finish
XDP_TX. This is less efficient and unnecessary after XDP transmission
were implemented. So switch to use native XDP transmission routine to
do this and reuse the xdp_flush_needed to implement some kind of
batching by delay the notification after several packets.
