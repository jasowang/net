virtio-net: correctly transmit XDP buff after linearizing

We should not go for the error path after successfully transmitting a
XDP buffer after linearizing. Since the error path may try to pop and
drop next packet and increase the drop counters. Fixing this by simply
drop the refcnt of original page and go for xmit path.
