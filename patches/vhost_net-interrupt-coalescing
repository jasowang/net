vhost_net: interrupt coalescing support

This patch implements interrupt coalescing support for vhost_net. And provides
ioctl()s for userspace to get and set coalescing parameters. Two kinds of
parameters were allowed to be set:

- max_coalesced_frames: which is the maximum numbers of packets were allowed
  before issuing an irq.
- coalesced_usecs: which is the maximum number of micro seconds were allowed
  before issuing an irq if at least one packet were pending.

A per virtqueue hrtimer were used for coalesced_usecs.
