tuntap: use software hash in flow caches

Some card can provides L4 hash, this may confuse flow cache in tuntap
since it expects software hash in finding flows. Fixing this by:

1) record rps_hash, this will probably be used by saving rps hash
2) clear skb hash if it was not L4
3) get software hash and use it for flow caches
