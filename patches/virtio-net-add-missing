virtio-net: add missing virtqueue kick when flushing packets

We tends to batch submitting packets during XDP_TX. This requires to
kick virtqueue after a batch, we tried to do it through
xdp_do_flush_map() which only makes sense for the case of redirection
not XDP_TX. So explicit kick the virtqueue in this case.
